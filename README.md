# Isidubada Translator

A fake language encoded in a way for others not understand. 

Rules to how it works, after ever vowel just add the letter d and the vowel itself.
***Lu becomes Ludu (Lu-du)***.
My name **Lukhanyo** would be: **Ludukhadanyodo**.

I have only seen this spoken and written for my home language ***isiXhosa*** am not sure about other languagesğŸ¤” but it's similar in a fun way to Pig Latin.

Only did this as a joke after being reminded about itğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
